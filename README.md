# Java-DSA

A curated, topic-oriented collection of **Core Java** concepts and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems — focused on Strings, Arrays, Collections and common interview-style programming exercises.  
Designed for learners preparing for interviews as well as developers who want a concise reference of idiomatic Java solutions and small utilities.

> This repository contains topic-wise examples and practice code organized into folders such as `CoreJava`, `CodePractice`, and `JavaProgramming`. The codebase is primarily Java.

## What’s in this repo

- `CoreJava/` – Core language concepts, OOP examples, and small utilities (exceptions, generics, I/O patterns, etc.). 
- `CodePractice/` – Problem-focused practice code (topic-wise problems and examples). 
- `JavaProgramming/` – Additional exercises, sample programs and learning snippets. 

> Language: **Java** (the repository is predominantly Java).
