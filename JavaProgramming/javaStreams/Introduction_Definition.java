/*Java Streams in Simple Terms
Think of Java Streams like a conveyor belt in a factory. 
Items (data) move along the belt, and you can apply various operations to transform, 
filter, or collect them without modifying the original items.*/


/*1. Java Streams
Introduced in Java 8, Streams provide a way to process collections of data in a functional and 
declarative manner.

2.Streams allow you to filter, map, reduce, and collect data efficiently.

3. Streams do not store data but operate on the data source and produce results based on the pipeline of operations.

/*Basic Stream Workflow
Create a Stream → Get data from a collection or array.

Apply Operations → Transform or filter the data (map(), filter(), etc.).

Get the Result → Use collect(), forEach(), or reduce().*/
