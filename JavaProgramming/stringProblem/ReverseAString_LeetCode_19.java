/*Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Solution - You can reverse the array in-place using a two-pointer approach â€” one pointer starting at the beginning of 
the array and the other at the end, swapping elements until they meet.
